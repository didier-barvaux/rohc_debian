Introduction
------------

This piece of software is an implementation of RObust Header Compression for
Linux (or other Unix-compatible OS). The library can be used to add ROHC
compression/decompression capabilities to an application.

License
-------

The project is licensed under GPL2+, see the COPYING and AUTHORS files for more
details.


Libraries
---------

The sources are in the src subdirectory. The sources are separated into three
libraries:
 - a library that contains the routines used for both the compression and the
   decompression processes
 - a library that handles the compression process
 - a library that handles the decompression process

See the INSTALL file to learn to build the libraries.


Automated tests
---------------

The test subdirectory contains several test applications. See the INSTALL file
to learn how to use these tools.


Statistics
----------

The statistics subdirectory contains an application that generates some
compression statistics. The generate_statistics.sh script outputs a HTML report
with the statistics results. The Gnuplot tool is required.

See the INSTALL file to learn how to use the statistics application and the
generate_statistics.sh script.


Known problems
--------------

The following problems are known but are not corrected in the 1.5.x branch.

 - RTP profile: unscaled TS shall always be encoded with W-LSB in UO* packets

   According to RFC 4815, ยง4.1:
     RTP Timestamp (TS) values are always encoded using W-LSB encoding,
     both when sent scaled and unscaled. When no TS bits are transmitted
     in a compressed packet, TS is always scaled. If a compressed packet
     carries an Extension 3 and field(Tsc)=0, the compressed packet must
     thus always carry unscaled TS bits. For TS values sent in Extension
     3, W-LSB encoded values are sent using the self-describing variable-
     length format (RFC 3095-Section 4.5.6), and this applies to both
     scaled and unscaled values.
   The TS bits in UO* packets shall always be transmitted encoded with W-LSB.
   W-LSB encoding shall be used if TS is scaled or unscaled. The ROHC library
   does use W-LSB for scaled TS but not for unscaled TS. This is not RFC
   compliant.
   The problem will not be fixed in the 1.6.x branch since they will be
   invasive and would break compatibility between 1.6.x releases.
   See https://bugs.launchpad.net/rohc/+bug/1208900

 - IP-ID shall be transmitted verbatim in IR and IR-DYN packets

   According to RFC 4815 and discussion on the IETF list
   (http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/rohc/current/msg01675.html):
     - "IP-ID" means that the Identification field is transmitted encoded with
       the method "Offset IP-ID", ie. offset between SN and IP-ID and then
       byte-swapped according to the NBO flag.
     - "Identification" means that the Identification field is transmitted
       verbatim, ie. unchanged wrt the non compressed packet.
   The ROHC library is not conform: the dynamic part of the IPv4 header in the
   IR and IR-DYN packets shall contain the verbation Identification field, not
   the byte-swapped value.
   The problem will not be fixed in the 1.6.x branch since they will be
   invasive and would break compatibility between 1.6.x releases.
