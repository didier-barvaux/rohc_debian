  RawPacketIPv6Tunnel-UK6x.cap (libpcap) - Some IPv6 packets captured from the
  'sit1' interface on Linux. The IPv6 packets are carried over the UK's UK6x
  network, but what makes this special, is the fact that it has a Link-Layer
  type of "Raw packet data" - which is something that you don't see everyday.

What makes this capture special for the ROHC library is the IPv6/TCP flow with
a non-zero Flow Label.
