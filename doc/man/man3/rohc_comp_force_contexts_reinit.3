.SH "NAME"
rohc_comp_force_contexts_reinit \- Force the compressor to re-initialize all its contexts.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <rohc/rohc_comp.h>
.sp
\fBbool rohc_comp_force_contexts_reinit\fP(
    \fBstruct rohc_comp *const  comp\fP
);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP 
Make all contexts restart their initialization with decompressor, ie. they go in the lowest compression state. This function can be used once the ROHC channel is established again after an interruption.
.PP 
The function implements the CONTEXT_REINITIALIZATION signal described by RFC 3095 at ยง6.3.1 as:    CONTEXT_REINITIALIZATION \-\- signal
.PP 
   This parameter triggers a reinitialization of the entire context at
.PP 
   the decompressor, both the static and the dynamic part.  The
.PP 
   compressor MUST, when CONTEXT_REINITIALIZATION is triggered, back off
.PP 
   to the IR state and fully reinitialize the context by sending IR
.PP 
   packets with both the static and dynamic chains covering the entire
.PP 
   uncompressed headers until it is reasonably confident that the
.PP 
   decompressor contexts are reinitialized.  The context
.PP 
   reinitialization MUST be done for all contexts at the compressor.
.PP 
   This parameter may for instance be used to do context relocation at,
.PP 
   e.g., a cellular handover that results in a change of compression
.PP 
   point in the radio access network.
