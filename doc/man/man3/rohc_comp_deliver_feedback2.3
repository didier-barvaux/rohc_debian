.SH "NAME"
rohc_comp_deliver_feedback2 \- Deliver a feedback packet to the compressor.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <rohc/rohc_comp.h>
.sp
\fBbool rohc_comp_deliver_feedback2\fP(
    \fBstruct rohc_comp *const  comp\fP,
    \fBconst struct rohc_buf    feedback\fP
);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP 
When feedback data is received by a decompressor, this function may be called to deliver the feedback data to the corresponding profile/context on the same\-side associated compressor.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.B comp
The ROHC compressor 
.TP
.B feedback
The feedback data 
.SH STRUCTURES
.SS "A network buffer for the ROHC library"
.PP
.sp
.PP 
May represent one uncompressed packet, one ROHC packet, or a ROHC feedback.
.PP 
The network buffer does not contain the packet data itself. It only has a pointer on it. This is designed this way for performance reasons: no copy required to initialize a network buffer, the struct is small and may be passed as copy to function.
.PP 
The network buffer is able to keep some free space at its beginning. The unused space at the beginning of the buffer may be used to prepend a network header at the very end of the packet handling.
.PP 
The beginning of the network buffer may also be shifted forward with the \fBrohc_buf_pull\fP function or shifted backward with the \fBrohc_buf_push\fP function. This is useful when parsing a network packet (once bytes are read, shift them forward) for example.
.PP 
The network buffer may be initialized manually (see below) or with the helper functions \fBrohc_buf_init_empty\fP or \fBrohc_buf_init_full\fP...

struct \fBrohc_buf\fP {
  struct rohc_ts \fItime\fP;    /* The timestamp associated to the data */
  uint8_t       *\fIdata\fP;    /* The buffer data */
  size_t         \fImax_len\fP; /* The maximum length of the buffer */
  size_t         \fIoffset\fP;  /* The offset for the beginning of the data */
  size_t         \fIlen\fP;     /* The data length (in bytes) */
};

.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
true if the feedback was successfully taken into account, false if the feedback could not be taken into account
