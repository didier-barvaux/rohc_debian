.SH "NAME"
rohc_buf_push \- Push the beginning of the given network buffer.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <rohc/rohc.h>
.sp
\fBvoid rohc_buf_push\fP(
    \fBstruct rohc_buf *const  buf\fP,
    \fBconst size_t            offset\fP
);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP 
Pushing the beginning of the buffer decreases the space at the beginning of the buffer. This is useful to prepend a network header before the network buffer.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.B buf
The network buffer to check for 
.TP
.B offset
The offset to push the beginning of the buffer of 
.SH STRUCTURES
.SS "A network buffer for the ROHC library"
.PP
.sp
.PP 
May represent one uncompressed packet, one ROHC packet, or a ROHC feedback.
.PP 
The network buffer does not contain the packet data itself. It only has a pointer on it. This is designed this way for performance reasons: no copy required to initialize a network buffer, the struct is small and may be passed as copy to function.
.PP 
The network buffer is able to keep some free space at its beginning. The unused space at the beginning of the buffer may be used to prepend a network header at the very end of the packet handling.
.PP 
The beginning of the network buffer may also be shifted forward with the \fBrohc_buf_pull\fP function or shifted backward with the \fBrohc_buf_push\fP function. This is useful when parsing a network packet (once bytes are read, shift them forward) for example.
.PP 
The network buffer may be initialized manually (see below) or with the helper functions \fBrohc_buf_init_empty\fP or \fBrohc_buf_init_full\fP...
