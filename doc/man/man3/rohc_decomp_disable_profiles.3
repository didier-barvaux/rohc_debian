rohc_decomp_disable_profiles \- Disable several decompression profiles for a decompressor.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <rohc/rohc_decomp.h>
.sp
\fBbool rohc_decomp_disable_profiles\fP(
    \fBstruct rohc_decomp *const  decomp\fP,
    \fB...\fP
);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP 
Disable several decompression profiles for a decompressor. The list of profiles to disable shall stop with \-1.
.PP 
The ROHC decompressor does not use the decompression profiles that were disabled. Thus disabling a profile might cause the decompressor to reject streams. Decompression will always fail if no profile at all is enabled.
.PP 
If one or more of the profiles are already disabled, nothing is performed and success is reported.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.B decomp
The ROHC decompressor 
.TP

The sequence of decompression profiles to disable, the sequence shall be terminated by \-1
