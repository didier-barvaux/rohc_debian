.SH "NAME"
rohc_decomp_get_mrru \- Get the Maximum Reconstructed Reception Unit (MRRU).
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <rohc/rohc_decomp.h>
.sp
\fBbool rohc_decomp_get_mrru\fP(
    \fBconst struct rohc_decomp *const  decomp\fP,
    \fBsize_t *const                    mrru\fP
);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP 
Get the current Maximum Reconstructed Reception Unit (MRRU).
.PP 
The MRRU is the largest cumulative length (in bytes) of the ROHC segments that are parts of the same ROHC packet. In short, the ROHC decompressor does not expect to reassemble ROHC segments whose total length is larger than MRRU. So, the ROHC compressor shall not segment ROHC packets greater than the MRRU.
.PP 
The MRRU value must be in range [0 ; \fBROHC_MAX_MRRU\fP]. Remember that the MRRU includes the 32\-bit CRC that protects it. If MRRU value is 0, segmentation is disabled.
.PP 
If segmentation is enabled and used by the compressor, the function \fBrohc_decompress3\fP will return ROHC_OK and one empty uncompressed packet upon decompression until the last segment is received (or a non\-segment is received). Decompressed data will be returned at that time.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.B decomp
The ROHC decompressor 
.TP
.B mrru [output]
The current MRRU value (in bytes)

.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
true if MRRU was successfully retrieved, false otherwise
