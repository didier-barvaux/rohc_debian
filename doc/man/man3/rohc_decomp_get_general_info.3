.SH "NAME"
rohc_decomp_get_general_info \- Get some general information about the decompressor.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <rohc/rohc_decomp.h>
.sp
\fBbool rohc_decomp_get_general_info\fP(
    \fBconst struct rohc_decomp *const    decomp\fP,
    \fBrohc_decomp_general_info_t *const  info\fP
);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP 
Get some general information about the decompressor.
.PP 
To use the function, call it with a pointer on a pre-allocated rohc_decomp_general_info_t structure with the \fBversion_major\fP and \fBversion_minor\fP fields set to one of the following supported versions:
.PP 
.RS
.PP 
\(bu Major 0, minor 0
.PP 
.RE
.PP 
See the rohc_decomp_general_info_t structure for details about fields that are supported in the above versions.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.B decomp
The ROHC decompressor to get information from 
.TP
.B info [input, output]
The structure where information will be stored 
.SH STRUCTURES
.SS "Some general information about the decompressor"
.PP
.sp
.PP 
The structure is used by the \fBrohc_decomp_get_general_info\fP function to store some general information about the decompressor.
.PP 
Versioning works as follow:
.PP 
.RS
.PP 
\(bu The \fBversion_major\fP field defines the compatibility level. If the major number given by user does not match the one expected by the library, an error is returned.
.PP 
\(bu The \fBversion_minor\fP field defines the extension level. If the minor number given by user does not match the one expected by the library, only the fields supported in that minor version will be filled by \fBrohc_decomp_get_general_info\fP.
.PP 
.RE
.PP 
Notes for developers:
.PP 
.RS
.PP 
\(bu Increase the major version if a field is removed.
.PP 
\(bu Increase the major version if a field is added at the beginning or in the middle of the structure.
.PP 
\(bu Increase the minor version if a field is added at the very end of the structure.
.PP 
\(bu The version_major and version_minor fields must be located at the very beginning of the structure.
.PP 
\(bu The structure must be packed.
