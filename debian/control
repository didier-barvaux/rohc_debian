 RObust Header Compression (ROHC) is a standardized method defined by the IETF
 in RFC3095 to compress the IP, UDP, RTP, and TCP headers of Internet packets.
 This compression scheme differs from other compression schemes by the fact
 that it performs well over links where the packet loss rate is high, such as
 wireless links.
